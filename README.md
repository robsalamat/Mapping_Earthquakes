# Mapping_Earthquakes

## I. Overview of Project

### Background
As a data visualization specialist for the Disaster Reporting Network working with Basil and Sadhana, the task was to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website. The data was traversed and retrieved using Javascript and D3 leaflet libraries and plotted on a Mapbox map through an API request.

### Objective
Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
